This is a project I started and finished over a year ago following the instructions of an online course in udemy called Unreal 
Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games. 

Sadly, I never got to the Unreal part of the course due to lack of time because I was concentrated on school and extra curricular 
activities.

In this project, I learned the basics of C++ and Game Design, including but not limited to:

• Game Design Documents

• Function Syntax 

• Using #include 

• Getting input using cin

• legibility of code

• and much more!
